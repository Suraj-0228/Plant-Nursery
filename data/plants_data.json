    "description": "Tulsi is a sacred plant in India, used for its medicinal and spiritual value. Thrives in sunlight with regular watering.",
    "careInstructions": {
      "Light": "Tulsi grows best in bright, direct sunlight. Place it where it gets at least 5–6 hours of sunlight daily. Indoor pots should be near a sunny window or balcony.",
      "Watering": "Keep the soil evenly moist but not soggy. In summer, water daily in small amounts; in winter, water every 2–3 days. Always check the top layer of soil before watering.",
      "Soil": "Tulsi thrives in well-drained, loamy soil enriched with compost. Regular addition of organic matter keeps it healthy. Avoid clay soil as it holds too much water.",
      "Temperature": "The ideal range is 15–35°C. Protect from frost and cold drafts in winter. During hot summers, provide light shade in the afternoon.",
      "Humidity": "It prefers moderate humidity. Mist the leaves occasionally in dry climates to prevent leaf dryness. Good airflow helps prevent fungal infections.",
      "Pests": "Prone to aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Neem oil spray is effective against pests. Overwatering may lead to fungal root rot."
